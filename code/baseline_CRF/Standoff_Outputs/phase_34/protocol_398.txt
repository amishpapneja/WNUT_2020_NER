Subcellular Fractionation from Animal Cells (FOCUSâ¢ SubCell Kit)
OPTIONAL : Add appropriate protease inhibitor cocktail (e.g. GâBiosciences â ProteaseArrest, Cat. # 786â108) to SubCell BufferâI immediately prior to use.
Use fresh cells only.
Pellet the harvested cells by centrifugation at ~ 800 x g for 1 minute.
Carefully remove and discard the supernatant.
Gently vortex to suspend the cells and incubate on ice for 10 minutes.
Add 500Âµl of ice cold SubCell BufferâI.
Perform this lysis step on ice.
Using a narrow opening (20 gauge) syringe needle, gently pull the suspension up and down 10â30 times.
Add 250Âµl 3X SubCell BufferâII (350Âµl if Dounce homogenizer is used) and mix by inverting.
Centrifuge the tube at 700x g for 10 minutes to pellet the nuclei.
Transfer the supernatant to a new tube.
Centrifuge supernatant at 12,000 x g for 15 minutes.
Transfer the supernatant (post mitochondria) to a new tube for further processing.
The pellet contains mitochondria.
Add 500Âµl 1X SubCell BufferâII to the pellet, and centrifuge again at 12,000 x g for 5 minutes.
Discard the supernatant.
Resuspend the mitochondrial pellet with 50â100Âµl Working Mitochondria Storage Buffer and keep the suspension on ice before downstream processing.
Enrichment of other cell organelles : The post mitochondria supernatant from steps 8-9 can be further fractionated using a variety of gradient and differential centrifugations.
