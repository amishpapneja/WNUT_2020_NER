Tube-O-Dialyzer (No Loss Dialyzer for Small Samples)
TubeâOâDIALYZERâ¢ are supplied in a preservative to maintain quality.
Prior to use discard the preservative from the tube and place the dialysis cap upside down in a beaker or other suitable container.
Pipette your sample directly into the TubeâOâDIALYZERâ¢ tube.
For TubeâOâDIALYZERâ¢ Micro use 20â250Âµl and for TubeâOâDIALYZERâ¢ Medi use 0.2 â 2.5 ml.
Remove the TubeâOâDIALYZERâ¢ dialysis cap from the rinse water/buffer and carefully remove excess liquid with a pipette tip.
Screw the dialysis cap on to the TubeâOâDIALYZERâ¢ tube until finger tight.
Invert the TubeâOâDIALYZERâ¢, ensuring the entire sample rests upon the membrane.
Keeping the TubeâOâDIALYZERâ¢ in an inverted position, slide the supplied float onto the TubeâOâDIALYZERâ¢ tube.
Place the TubeâOâDIALYZERâ¢ in the dialysis buffer.
Ensure that the dialysis membrane contacts the dialysis buffer.
If there are large air bubbles trapped underneath the dialysis membrane surface, tilt the tube or squirt buffer to remove the air bubbles.
Dialysis Time : Dialysis time will depend on the nature of sample, MWCO of the TubeâOâDIALYZERâ¢, sample and dialysis buffer volume and concentration.
Higher MWCO will allow faster dialysis.
As a guide, the sample should be dialyzed for 2â12h.
Dialysis buffer should also be replaced at least once during dialysis.
After dialysis, remove the TubeâOâDIALYZERâ¢ from the float and immediately spin the TubeâOâDIALYZERâ¢ (in upâright position) for 5â6 seconds at 500â 1,000 xg.
Discard the dialysis cap and replace with the supplied Storage Cap.
Add 1â2ml DI water or dialysis buffer to rinse.
Keep the TubeâOâDIALYZERâ¢ membrane wet until required.
Gently, stir the dialysis buffer.
For efficient and complete dialysis we recommend inverting or gently tapping the TubeâOâDIALYZERâ¢ 1â2 times during dialysis to mix the sample.
