with	O
your	O
user	B-Reagent

Create	B-Action
a	O

Go	B-Action

Go	B-Action

We	O

You	O

Put	B-Action

config.sh:	O
Now	O
we	O
need	O
to	O
create	B-Action
the	O
config.sh	B-Reagent
script.	I-Reagent

This	O
script	O

The	O
idea	O

this	O

is	O
to	O
give	O
the	O

one	O

to	O
make	O
any	O

they	O
need	O

The	O

the	O
