Gently mix the reaction Collect all liquid to the bottom of the tube by a quick spin if necessary and overlay the sample with mineral oil if using a PCR machine without a heated lid.
Quickly transfer PCR tubes to a thermocycler preheated to the denaturation temperature (94 C) and begin thermocycling
