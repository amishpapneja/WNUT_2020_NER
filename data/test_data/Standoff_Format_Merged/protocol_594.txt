Screening Recombinant Clones by PCR.
Transfer the transformed clones to a stock LB-Amp or other appropriate plated media.
Grow for 24 hr at 37 C.
Prepare forward and reverse primers for the vector used for transformation at 100 ng/ l in DDH2O.
See table in guidelines for recommended primers to use with pUC18 vector.
Label thin-walled tubes.
Prepare 1 ml of Master Mix :

Vortex and spin Master Mix and dispense 20 l per thin-walled tube.
Cap all tubes.
Set a 10 l pipetter to 1 l.
Place tranformant plate on template and touch the pipette tip to the appropriate colony.
Pipette up and down in the appropriate PCR tube.
Re-cap tube, change tip and repeat steps 9-10 until all colonies have been added.
Perform PCR using the thermal cycling protocol :
95 C5 minutes1 cycle95 C55 C70 C30 seconds30 seconds30 seconds*35 cycles70 C7 minutes1 cycle4-10 C Hold cycle*increase to 1 minute if insert is great than 1 Kb.
Remove tubes at end of thermal cycling.
Add 2 l 10x gel loading buffer to each tube.
Spin to bring contents to bottom of tube and load 10 l into lane of a 1 % agarose gel in 0.5x TBE buffer.
