OmniPrepâ¢ For High Quality Genomic DNA Extraction From Fungal Tissue
Collect fungal tissue from liquid culture and wash 2-3 times in sterile water.
Fungal mycelia are best prepared by grinding samples using Molecular Grinding Resinâ¢ in Genomic Lysis Buffer.
For fungal teliospores, grinding samples in liquid nitrogen to a fine powder and quickly add to an appropriate volume of Genomic Lysis Buffer is recommended.
Add 10-20mg fungal mycelia to a microcentrifuge tube containing 500Âµl Genomic Lysis Buffer.
Add 30Âµl Molecular Grinding Resinâ¢ using a wide bore pipette tips and grind with a microcentrifuge pestle.
For teliospoes, add ground powder to 500Âµl Genomic Lysis Buffer and vortex to wet sample.
Allow the sample to cool to room temperature.
Add 200Âµl chloroform and mix by inverting the tube several times.
Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 14,000 xg and carefully remove the upper phase to a clean microcentrifuge tube.
Add 50Âµl DNA Stripping Solution to the sample and invert several times to mix.
Incubate the sample for 5-10 minutes at 60Â°C.
Add 100Âµl Precipitation Solution and mix by inverting the tube several times.
Centrifuge the sample at 14,000 xg for 5 minutes.
Transfer the supernatant to a clean tube and precipitate the genomic DNA with 500Âµl isopropanol.
Invert the tubes 10 times to precipitate the DNA.
OPTIONAL : For increased DNA recovery, add 2Âµl Mussel Glycogen as a DNA carrier.
Centrifuge at 14,000 xg for 5 minutes to pellet genomic DNA.
Remove the supernatant.
Add 700Âµl 70% ethanol to the tube and invert several times to wash the DNA pellet.
Centrifuge for 1 minute at 14,000 xg.
Decant or pipette off the ethanol wash.
Invert the tube on a clean absorbent surface for several minutes to allow any excess ethanol to drain away.
Add 50Âµl TE Buffer to the pellet.
Incubate at room temperature for at least 15 minutes to rehydrate.
OPTIONAL : 1Âµl LongLifeâ¢ RNase for every 100Âµl TE Buffer can be added at this stage.
Store DNA at 4Â°C, for long term storage store at -20Â°C or -80Â°C.
Add 1Âµl Proteinase K solution for every 100Âµl Lysis Buffer and incubate at 60Â°C for 1-2 hours.
Invert the tube periodically each hour.
